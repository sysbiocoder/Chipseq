Bowtie or BWA are better options for alignment
Bowtie2 is used usually when read lengths are more than 50bp
The major parameters to take note while aligning ChiP seq is -k mode: search for one or more alignments, report each and -N for allowing number of mismatches
assign -k as 1 and N as 1
For paired end sequencing alignment with Bowtie2

bowtie2 -p 14 -k 1 -N 1 -x $db/bowtie_idx/hg38.p13 -1 $dir/${infile}_1.fastq.gz -2 $dir/${infile}_2.fastq.gz | samtools view -bS -  > $outfolder/$infile.bam 

For single end sequencing with BWA

bwa aln $dbase/hg19 <(zcat $infolder/infile.fq.gz) > $outfolder/outfile.sai
bwa samse  $dbase/hg19 $outfolder/outfile.sai <(zcat $infolder/infile.fq.gz) > $outfolder/outfile.sam
samtools view -bSq 20  $outfolder/outfile.sam | samtools sort -o $outfolder/outfile_sorted.bam
